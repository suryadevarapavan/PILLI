I have forged a site for displaying my crafts and you can view it [here](https://jstpavan.freewebhostmost.com/)

<br>PILLI was my first prototype. I am programming it with C++, in the view that arduino uno supports C++. It is an IOT projects runs with help of Ultrasonc sensor and other components. This project uses Find-S algorithm to perform various tasks.It is constantly trained by data sets taken input. It is a component of 'PROJECT':"VM333".
<br>
<br> VM333- is virtual lifefrom(monster) it takes input from IOT components and provides output through LCD or OLED screen.
